* sshmount-netrc
[[https://badge.fury.io/py/sshmount-netrc.svg][http://badge.fury.io/py/sshmount-netrc]]

A small Python script that mounts ssh mount points using authentication from your .netrc (or alternatively .authinfo) file.

** Dependencies
You will need the =sshfs= package installed and in the =PATH=.

On Arch linux it is located in the Community repo. You can install it using:
#+begin_src bash
pacman -S sshfs
#+end_src


** Installation
#+begin_src bash
python setup.py install
#+end_src

** Usage
*** netrc configuration
Your netrc file should have a line matching the following pattern:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
machine my_server_name    login my_login    password my_password
#+END_EXAMPLE




*** command
Its simplest form: 
#+begin_src bash
sshmount-netrc my_server_name
#+end_src

Specifying a custom mount point:
#+begin_src bash
sshmount-netrc -m my_mount_point my_server_name
#+end_src

Specifying a custom netrc location:
#+begin_src bash
sshmount-netrc -f ~/.authinfo my_server_name
#+end_src


*** default mount point
If no mount_point is specified the following default will be used
#+begin_src bash
~/mnt/my_login@my_server_name
#+end_src

*** result
Under the hood, this script will then execute the following linux commad:
#+begin_src bash
echo my_password | sshfs -o password_stdin my_login@my_server_name: /my_mount_point
#+end_src

** Limitation
Currently you cannot have multiple logins on one machine. This is due to a long standing shortcoming  in the Python netrc library.
